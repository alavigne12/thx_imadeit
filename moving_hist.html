							<h1>Moving History Segments</h1>
						<p>These are some of my favorite segments I've created for MIPoPS quarterly screening series <i>Moving History</i>. I use a combination of archival moving image material and music licensed under Creative Commons. Created using <b>Adobe Premier Pro</b>.</p>

			<p>Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which forced more than 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry to abandon their homes, jobs, friends, and families, and relocate to one of 10 concentration camps, referred to as "Relocation Centers". Minidoka concentration camp was located in Jerome County, Idaho. At its peak, the camp housed over 13,000 people, making it the seventh largest city in the state of Idaho. This segment features archival footage from the Wing Luke Museum, alongside audio from oral histories recorded by Densho. This material was selected to be included in the touring roadshow of audiovisual material put on by the Association of Moving Image Architects.</p>

			<p>Peter Minshall is a legendary Trinidadian costume designer. He has been designing incredible costumes and choreographies for Carnival celebrations for over thirty years. In August 1985, he held The Adoration of Hiroshima in Washington, D.C. This was a carnival-style, anti-war, street theatre which was performed on the fortieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. The video footage comes from a tape in the Karen Morell Film, Audio and Videotape Collection at the University of Washington Libraries, Special Collections. Unfortunately, the material was silent, so I have included edited audio from a 1989 interview with Minshall.</p>

			<p>Filmmaker Karen Morell interviews Larry E. Bannock while he prepares his costume for Mardi Gras. Includes footage of Bannock wearing his costume in the parade with the Mardi Gras Indians. The Mardi Gras Indians are an important part of the African American experience of the carnival, and an enduring symbol of New Orleans. This material comes from the aren Morell Film, Audio and Videotape Collection at the University of Washington Libraries, Special Collections. The music is from a recording of a much later carnival released under a creative commons license.</p>

			<p>This material is part of over 12 hours of raw footage filmed for the 30-minute documentary Visible Target, produced by John de Graaf for Seattle Public Television (KCTS) in 1984. The documentary tells the story of the exclusion and internment of Japanese Americans from Bainbridge Island beginning in March 1942. They were the first 227 of 117,000 American residents of Japanese ancestry, 70,000 of them native-born U.S. citizens, forcibly removed from the Pacific coast and interned in camps across the deserts of the West for the duration of World War II. This material is part of the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Community (BIJAC) Collection at the Bainbridge Island Historical Museum.</p>

			<p>Giovanni Costigan was a beloved professor of Irish History at the University of Washington for more than 40 years. According to a former student, "his classes were always packed, even on days when the Quad was lit with spring and promise." His opposition to the Vietnam war was well known on campus. Students turned to him in May 1970 when they were deciding whether to strike, and shut the UW down, or not. The song in the introduction is "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die" by Country Joe and the Fish. Released in 1967, it became one of the most popular Vietnam protest songs. Interviews are part of the Don Schmechel Oral History Collection at the Museum of History and Industry.</p>
